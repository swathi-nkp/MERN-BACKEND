1. What is JavaScript ?
    JavaScript is a programming language that makes websites interactive. It runs in web browsers and allows pages to respond to user actions like clicks, typing, and animations.

2. What are variables ?
    A variable is a named container used to store data so you can use or change it later in your program. In JavaScript, we create variables using let, const, or var.

3. Difference between var, let, const?
    Var = old, function-scoped, can re-declare
    let = modern, block-scoped, can update
    const = block-scoped, cannot update, must assign value

4. What is data type?
    A data type in JavaScript specifies the type of value a variable can hold. It defines how the data is stored, used, and manipulated in a program.

5. Types of primitive data types?
    1.string
    2.boolean
    3.bigint
    4.symbol
    5.undefined
    6.null
    7.number

6. What are non-primitive data types?
    1.object {}
    2.array []
    3.function(){}

7. What are operator?
   An operator in JavaScript is a symbol or special character that tells the program to perform a specific operation on one or more values (called operands).

8. Types of operators?
   1. Arithmetic Operators - (+,-,*,%,/,++,--)
   2. Assignment Operators - (=, +=, -=, *=, /=)
   3. Comparison Operators – (==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=)
   4. Logical Operators – (&& (AND), || (OR), ! (NOT))
   5. Bitwise Operators – (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>)
   6. Ternary Operator – (condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse)
   7. Type Operators –(typeof, instanceof)

9. What is expression? 
    An expression in JavaScript is any piece of code that produces a value. It can be as simple as a number or variable, or more complex like a calculation or function call.

10. What is statement?
    A statement in JavaScript is a line or block of code that performs an action but does not necessarily produce a value. Statements control the flow of a program, like executing code conditionally, looping, or declaring variables.

11. What is control statement?
    A control statement in JavaScript is a statement that controls the flow of execution in a program. It decides which code runs, how many times it runs, or under what conditions.
    1. Conditional Statements – (if, if-else, if-else if-else, switch)
    2. Looping Statements - (for, while, do-while, for...of, for...in)
    3. Jump Statements – (break, continue, return, throw)

12. What are conditional statements?
    Conditional statements in JavaScript are used to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true. They help the program make decisions based on certain conditions.

13. What are looping statements?
    Looping statements in JavaScript are used to repeat a block of code multiple times until a specified condition is met. They help automate repetitive tasks and avoid writing the same code again and again.
    1. For loop
    2. while loop
    3. do while

14. What is hoisting?
    Hoisting is JavaScript’s behavior of moving variable and function declarations to the top of their scope before code execution.

15. What is scope?
    Scope in JavaScript defines the accessibility or visibility of variables and functions in different parts of the code. It determines where a variable can be used.
    1. Function scope
    2. Global scope
    3. block scope

16. What is closure?
    A closure is a function that remembers and can access variables from its outer function even after the outer function has finished executing.
